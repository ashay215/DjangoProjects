This is a simple Django web app that takes in user info, including a phone number, to create a user stored in a database.
The phone number is verified by texting to it a PIN, which upon entry confirms the creation of a new user.
Users can also login by entering their information and their phone number, receiving a text, and entering it, to see their profile page.

The Twilio API was used to send text messages, and SQLite was used for the backend database.

Please see README.pdf for details, screenshots, and an explanation of the project.
